#Semver policy for Steve

Steve follows the `major.minor.bugfix` semver policy.

A major change is one that adds an entirely new behavior to Steve, either dealing with a new webhook, or adding a new thing to do when an existing event is recived.

A minor change is one that changes the behavior of a current event, these should be fairly rare.

A bugfix change does not change the behavior of a current event outside of fixing unintended behavior, like crashing or mangling strings
